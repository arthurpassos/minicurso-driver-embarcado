### Introduction to the development of device drivers in embedded systems - Source Code

This repository contains the source code of a short course on embedded device drivers which I presented at the University of the Valley of Itaja√≠ - UNIVALI.

## Goals

- Understand the necessity of device drivers;
- Understand the daily routine of a device driver developer;
- Implement the fundamental operations (read, write and erase) of a S25FL164K flash memory;
- Use OOP and design patterns to abstract the hardware details from the user;

## Enviroment

Processor MKL16Z;
Kinetis Design Studio 3.2;
ProcessorExpert;
GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain 8+;
Segger J-Link.

## Notes
The unimplemented methods are left for the user to implement them.
